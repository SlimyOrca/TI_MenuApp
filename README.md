# TI_MenuApp

This was the really fun part of the portfolio assignment. I was able to test my understanding of react and css code. What I did was make two seperate components and I added another array. This array listed the options for the goals I had, and contained the difficulty of each goal. I made a secondary array and listed all of the goals that I had and the information within these goals. I then made a component called tuckeritem which has the formatting for the list and details of the list. I then made another component called aboutme, which contained a giant div box with information about me and it also contained the list component itself.
